# Utopia-Files [OLD]
Files related to the Utopia Minecraft server.
Utopia is my privately-owned Minecraft server. This repository is primarily for distributing the textures files used by the server, and whatever else I decide to use it for.

This repository has been abandoned due to a github pages publishing bug, the same as described in https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/23226 . A new one has been created in its place.
